## In this case study I learned the difference between euclidean and Manhattan distances using a colorbar in python. The data set had three coordinates of X,Y and Z.

## 1. Euclidean Distance

First we made colorbar of all the euclidean distances of Y and Z in our dataset to our selected location of Y=5, Z=5. The different colors represent the euclidean distance to our selected location.

Most of the distances are in the middle around 3-6. Almost symetrical distribution.

## 2. Manhattan Distance

The manhattan distance is the sum of absolute differences between the points coordinates. An interesting fact about the manhattan distance is that it measure distances along the coorinate axis. This creates "paths" that look like a cab's route on a grid-style city map. That is why it is also called taxicab or city block distance.

Here we did a colorbar of the manhattan distance of each point to our reference point of X=4, Z=4.

Once again most of the manhattan distances are in the middle from 4.5-9.5. Almost a standard distrubtion but many of the points have a lower than a higher value.
